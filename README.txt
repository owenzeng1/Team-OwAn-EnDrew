# Team-OwAn-EnDrew
The player acts as a tactician looking over his units. The player will tell each unit to where to "move" and to "attack" or ' wait". The main objective of the level is described to be either "Rout the enemy", "Defend for <#> turns", or "Defeat the enemy boss". There will be 6 unique units that the player can handle and unique skills for each. They will fight with swords, axes, lances, magic tomes, bows, or a mix of the above. Additionally to add to the strategic value, there will be a weapon triangle (rock, paper, scissors style) with swords, lances, and axes. Will try to program multiple levels if possible. Weapons have a set durability and will break after x amount of uses. An item shop will be included on each level so the player may restock/buy stronger weapons.
